                hi, r u free tonight? for me to text u? but i dont want u to feel suffocated with this. 

                r u ok with us like this? we’re not talking for months. to meet up, i knew im wrong. u already initiated many times, u made the efforts, but i’m the one who didn’t. i’m sorry for things i did wrong to u and may have hurt u in ways i didn’t realize. i removed n unfollowed u on some social media accounts, it’s just the initial thoughts of how different u were to me and to ur other friends. i just want to protect my feelings. if u think it’s not a big deal to u n ure ok with that, i’m sorry u had to listen to my explanation bcs u seemed unbothered though and this is just what i feel.

                <br><br><br>it will be a lie if i say i didn’t think about u even once. if u think it hurts me, yes, it did. it hurts so much. i thought the least ure gonna do is wish me happy birthday since u didn’t congratulate me for my convocation even ure apart of my dip journey. i waited for ur text the whole day, even with people wishing me, i still hoped u would.

                it feels weird u know bcs ure once someone really close to me, and my family keeps on asking what ure doing now. i just said, yasmin okay je, dia keje sambil study. i don’t say we don’t talk anymore because i hope one day we will again. ure so independent and that made my family always remember u though. 

                <br><br><br>i remembered how excited u were when u reached 600 followers on ig, and i was genuinely happy for u cuz i know it’s hard to get to that stage. i’m happy for ur milestones, which i knew would lead to many more things for u n ur company in the future. ure really aspiring for that one. the last 3 weeks or 4, can’t remember, i saw ur company lorry at my neighborhood cuz i just finished class that time. i wanted to tell u, but then i remembered we’re not talking for months. n in afraid if i text u, u’d be like, ok.

                how i cant remember u? everything in my surroundings reminds me of you even with my family. i knew that ure important to me. ure a very supportive friend in whatever ur friends do. i feel like ure comfortable and warm in person, and maybe ure not into texting cuz i feel the distant there. i dont want u to feel suffocated with my presence.

                <br><br><br>i know priorities have changed. but do u still love me as ur friend? or am i still a friend to u? i know u have many friends though, but i just want to know, which i hope u still do.

                <br><br><br>just let me know.

                <br><br><br>dont get me wrong, i texted u at night cuz i dont want to disturb ur work and study and i dont want this bottled up. i hope to get things right with u. 

                <br><br><br>thank you for spending ur time to read this, take ur time if u need to digest this, and things if u want to address about me or my behaviour :)
            </p>
